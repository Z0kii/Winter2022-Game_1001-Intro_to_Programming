/*
In a console application, create a gaming related haiku. Note: This haiku can be hard-coded in your source code.
Save the haiku to a text file called haiku.txt. Provide the user with the necessary confirmation messages of saving to a file.
In  another console application, read in the file haiku.txt and print out the contents to the console.
You do not need to create another project. Simply create another .cpp file.

NOTE: A haiku has a 5 - 7 - 5 syllable structure. First line has 5 syllables, second has 7 syllables, third has 5 syllables.

Submit  2 .cpp files called  OutputHaiku.cpp and  InputHaiku.cpp.
